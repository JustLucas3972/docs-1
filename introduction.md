## How to create a Minecraft server for free

**Serversify**  requires  [account](https://cp.serversify.net/register)  to create a  **Minecraft server**.

Start by creating an  **account**  at:  [https://cp.serversify.net/](https://cp.serversify.net/).

Once you have created your account, go to the "**Servers**"  **tab**, click on the "**Create Server**" button and  **fill out the information**.

After you created  **your server**, you will need to  **log in**  to our  [panel website](https://gp.serversify.net/auth/login)  to  **manage your servers**.

## Plugins

A  **plugin**  (or multiplayer plugin) is an  **add-on file**  for a Minecraft multiplayer  **server**.  **Plugins**  are often used to  **change certain aspects of the game**, such as adding user leaderboards or the "Factions" game mode.  **Plugins**  **do not change the game itself**, as a  **mod does**. After a plugin is installed on a server,  **you can find it on the help page by typing /help**.

### Setup:

1.  **download a plugin**  of your choice.
    
2.  **put the .jar file**  and all other files in the  **plugin directory**.
    
3.  **start the server**  and wait for it to load completely.
    
4.  in your Minecraft server console,  **type stop**  to stop the server.
    
5.  **start the server**.
    
6.  **that's it**! Your plugin should now be installed and ready to use.
